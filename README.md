# Group Work: PanelApp Gene List Networks

## Task

1. Create a network of genes based on Hereditary spastic paraplegia panelApp.
1. Define a list of genes you would add to each panel according to network
   analysis.
1. Assess quality of sources used to create the network.
1. Prioritise list of genes according to the strength of associations within
   your network.
1. What are the major pathway *types* that are involved in your group of pathologies?
1. Discuss the strategy use to create your network.
1. Discuss the limitations of this approach.

## Process

1. Fetch:
    - List of genes from STRING.
        - Meaning of network edges: confidence.
        - Active interaction sources: experiments, databases, coexpression.
        - Minimum required interaction score: medium confidence (0.4).
        - Maximum number of interactions: <= 50 1st shell, <= 50 2nd shell.
        - Network display mode: interactive.
        - Display simplifications: hide disconnected nodes in network.
    - List of genes from PanelApp
