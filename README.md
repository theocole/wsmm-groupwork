# Group Work: PanelApp Gene List Networks

## Task

1. Create a network of genes based on Hereditary spastic paraplegia panelApp.
1. Define a list of genes you would add to each panel according to network
   analysis.
1. Assess quality of sources used to create the network.
1. Prioritise list of genes according to the strength of associations within
   your network.
1. What are the major pathway *types* that are involved in your group of pathologies?
1. Discuss the strategy use to create your network.
1. Discuss the limitations of this approach.

## Process

1. Fetch a list of green genes from panelApp
1. Generate a STRING-DB network of all genes (including amber, red) using the following settings:
    - TODO: add settings here
1. Import gene network into Cytoscape 2.8.3 ('import network from file')
1. Carry out ModuLand analysis of the gene network to determine:
    - Level 1 Modules
    - 10 most central genes within each level 1 module.
